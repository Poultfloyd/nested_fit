# NESTED FIT

Nested_fit is a data program analysis based on the Bayesian statistics for the computation of, for a given set of data and chosen model, the complete probability distribution for each parameter and the Bayesian evidence.
The evidence calculation is based on the nested algorithm from Skilling 2004 [1,2] with the implementation of specific random walk for the search of new live points.
It is written in Fortran with some Python complementary routines for visualizing the output results and for doing automatic analyses of series of data.
More information on the program can be found in Refs. [3,4].
